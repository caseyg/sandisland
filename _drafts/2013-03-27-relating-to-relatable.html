I am annoyed by it partly because it is vague, and when I judge or grade student writing I stress that descriptions be as precise as possible. But "relatable" is more than vague; it is self-centered, impatient, even closed-minded, and it places too much value on personal perceptions.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: left;"><br /></span></div>My students use the word when they are trying to describe design that they like. For instance, one of my students was trying to articulate her feelings about clean, precise, geometric design versus design that is more expressive and roughly crafted. She likes imperfect design because it is more "relatable." "Relatable" design allows access; she finds something engaging in design that appears vital and organic, while shapes that look machine-made don't&nbsp;hold her attention because they are too familiar. I imagine her eye as a probe, scanning forms, sweeping over impermeable geometries, until coming to rest on jagged, broken shapes that suggest familiar emotions, or perhaps hidden mysteries. Students interested in advertising are most likely to use the word, as they want to learn how to attract and persuade through design, how to make things, as they say, "eye-catching." They think that one strategy for making appealing, successful advertisements is to make them "relatable."<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><i>The New York Times</i> drew attention to "relatable" in 2010 in an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/magazine/15onlanguage.html?_r=0" target="_blank">article </a>that traces the word to the middle of the twentieth century. According to the article, the word has been especially popular in the television industry, where it became "industry jargon for something with which viewers are supposed to identify or connect." The <i>Times</i> suggests that reality television is written to be especially "relatabl<span style="font-family: georgia, times new roman, times, serif;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">e."</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">The connection the&nbsp;<i>Times</i>&nbsp;draws between "relatable" and reality TV is illuminating. If TV shows about courtship (<i>The Bachelor</i>), competitive mothers (<i>Toddlers &amp; Tiaras</i>), and self-absorbed young adults (<i>Jersey Shore</i>) are meant to be "relatable" because they show us varieties of experience that we are familiar with, they can also become a carnival house of mirrors, capturing and reflecting ourselves endlessly. The reflected grotesques titillate with extremes of appearance and behavior that simultaneously revolt and attract. While reality TV can be entertaining, it is claustrophobic and expects little of the viewer. "Relatability" is only one aspect of creativity. Curiosity is another, openness to all human experience, not only the varieties in a designer's own region or age group.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">When my student who searches for "relatable" forms bypasses all geometry, I worry that she is being unimaginative at best, incurious and provincial at worst. But I won't be too hard on her, yet! She may be using the wrong word, this trendy one that seems to describe her youthful, incredibly important search for meaning. I suspect that she may find other adjectives to describe what she's looking for, and that she may learn to appreciate the value of control and precision in design. She wants to travel and there is nothing like travel to challenge the "relatable."</div><div><br /></div>
